        <h1>About Pleasant Grove</h1>
        <p>
          These early settlers were sent by Brigham Young, thus establishing the
          small community September 13, 1850. The pioneers were attracted by a
          small grove of trees which gave promise and hope of a land with water
          and rich soil. The official name "Pleasant Grove" didn't come first
          although the name was based on the small grove of trees that were here
          when they first arrived. The first name of this community was
          "Battlecreek", named after the first skirmish in Utah between the
          Indians and pioneers, located in the mouth of the canyon above this
          small community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the Indian conflicts, the settlers were instructed to build
          a fort for protection. A meeting house and school house were then
          constructed to meet the spiritual and educational needs of the people
          who came to Pleasant Grove. On January 19, 1855, the territorial
          legislature approved Pleasant Grove to become incorporated. The first
          municipal election was then held in May 1855 and Henson Walker took
          office as the first Mayor. Nicknames began popping up that described
          certain areas of the community: "Little Denmark" was the area where
          Scandinavian people settled: "Monkey Town" was named because the youth
          gathered on "fog" corner in the area and "monkeyed" around which
          caused adults great concern over the "...mischievousness of the
          youth." "Mud Hole" was an area where the community's merchandising and
          entertainment occurred. It was said that the "upper class" lived in
          this area.

        <h1>Strawberry Days History</h1>
        <p>
          The settlers were terrified of the Indians but also had to face famine
          and hunger. They had to rely on one another to survive a few winters.
          The meeting house was also used as a storehouse but a fire brought the
          building and it's contents to the ground and there just wasn't enough
          time to re-stock before winter came on again. Life wasn't all filled
          with hardships, however, people often met socially and because of the
          abundant strawberry crop every summer, "Strawberry Days" was created.
          Strawberry Days is the longest continuing community celebration in
          Utah to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strawberry fields are now gone, taken over by development. The
          school house still stands and has been converted into a very nice
          pioneer museum to remind us of those who came first, those who were
          willing to take the risk, make their homes in a relatively unknown
          wilderness and to prepare the way for those who came after.
