        <h3>Rhone</h3>

        />
        <p>
          A great example in my opinions of Fitt's law is the Rhone site. There
          is a large button to direct customers to the shopping page. They also
          have a large picture that acts the same as the button directing them
          to the shop page.

        <h3>Entrata</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.entrata.com/">entrata.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/entrata.jpg"
          alt="mobile screenshotof the main page for Entrata"
        />
        <p>
          The Entrata mobile site shows an a great example of Hick's Law. The
          site gives you two choices. You can either see stories from past
          customers/current users or you can request a demo of the service. This
          helps consumers decide if the service Entrata offers is best for them.

        <h2>White Space & Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>SoFi</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.sofi.com/">sofi.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/sofi.jpg"
          alt="mobile screenshotof the main page for SoFi"
        />
        <p>
          The SoFi site is very appealing in my eyes. Everything from the colors
          to the layout. And there isn't to many things going on. The blue color
          acts as white space since it covers a lot of the page.
